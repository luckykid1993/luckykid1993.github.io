This article is part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program: Write a Data Science Blog Post.
The purpose of this article is to put into practice how to communicate efficiently technical results, share ideas with stakeholders in a blog post.

Each year since 2011, Stack Overflow has asked developers about their favorite technologies, coding habits, and work preferences, as well as how they learn, share, and level up. 
The 2017 survey data covers 64,000 reviews and more than 150 questions. The original survey article is published here: 
[Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017)

You may have heard statements like “Java has become an old lady now, You Should Not Learn” or “you should learn python”.
So, Why people say that?
In this article, i used data from Stackoverflow’s 2017 Annual Developer Survey, to take a closer look at these questions:

> 1) Which were the most popular programming languages in 2017?

> 2) Which programming languages were the most people interested to work with over the next year?

> 3) Which programming language was most people loved?

# 1) Which were the most popular programming languages in 2017?

JavaScript was the most commonly used programming language (62%). It is used in many places: servers, Internet of Things, website...
The other reason is that JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically-typed language that can easily to learn and work with.

SQL takes second place (51%), it's no surprise, when we work with relational databases, we need SQL. SQL is nothing new and there are many large companies that make use of it.

Java takes third place (39%). The reason is that Java applications can run on several different types of platform, it is an OOP languages, robust, secure and simpler to learn. 
Many large companies use Java for their applications, even that Java is old, we still have to maintain applications that developed by Java.


# 2) Which programming languages were the most people interested to work with over the next year?

Most people interested to work with JavaScript in the nex year (of 2017). The reason is that it is used in many places, can easily to learn and work with.

Python features at number 2 (37%). It is really easy to learn and use, has a strong ecosystem of libraries. 
Python is suited for a variety of domains such as machine learning, big data... 
The other reason is that machine learning was the key trend 2017, and most people were using python for scientific research.

The third is SQL, it is necessary for working with relational databases.


# 3) Which programming language was most people loved?

It surprised me that Rust was the most loved programming language in 2017. I have never heard of this programming language before. 
Moreover, when we look at question 1 and question 2: very few people have used Rust. 
In fact, the data tell us that people loved Rust. Is it worth to learning Rust? I think we should give it a try.

So, What is Rust?

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. 
Syntactically similar to C++,Rust is notable for enforcing memory safety — that is, that all references point to valid memory — without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting like other memory-safe languages.
Memory safety is enforced by the compiler's borrow checker, which tracks object lifetime and variable scope as references are passed throughout the program. 
Rust is considered a systems programming language with mechanisms for low-level memory management, but also offers high-level features such as functional programming. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))

# Conclusion
In this article, we took a look at what were the most popular, the most interest and the most loved programming languages, according to Stackoverflow’s 2017 Survey data.

1. The older programming languages such as JavaScript, SQL, and Java are still in use.

2. Besides the old languages, many people started to want to use Python in 2017. It seems because artificial intelligence was the trend in 2017.

3. It surprised that Rust was the most loved programming language in 2017. The reason is because Rust offers high performance similar to C/C++, but more security and more. People have used it, like it, and then want to keep sticking to it.
